**#Reminder Application**
The Reminder App Project is designed to allow users to set reminders and receive notifications via email or text message. The system will use AWS services including DynamoDB, Lambda, SES, SNS, S3, and CloudFront to achieve the requirements. The following is a technical specification of the Reminder App Project system architecture.

Architecture
The Reminder App Project will consist of the following components:

API Gateway\n
Lambda function\n
DynamoDB table\n
SES or SNS service\n
S3 bucket\n
CloudFront distribution\n
API Gateway\n
The API Gateway will serve as the entry point for the Reminder App Project, allowing users to post new reminders. The API endpoint will be secured using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.

Lambda Function
The Lambda function will be triggered by the Time-To-Live (TTL) feature in DynamoDB, sending either an email or text message reminder to the user. The Lambda function will also handle the retrieval of reminders from the DynamoDB table.

DynamoDB Table
The DynamoDB table will store reminders as records, with a global secondary index (GSI) added to the table for querying based on user. The TTL feature will be used to trigger the Lambda function at the time of the reminder.

SES or SNS Service
The SES or SNS service will be used to send either an email or text message reminder to the user, depending on their preference.

S3 Bucket
The S3 bucket will be used to host the front-end app for viewing reminders.

CloudFront Distribution
The CloudFront distribution will be used to distribute the front-end app to users.

Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of data through the Reminder App Project system:

    participant CloudFront

    User->>API Gateway: Post Reminder
    API Gateway->>Lambda: Triggered
    Lambda->>DynamoDB: Store Reminder
    DynamoDB->>Lambda: TTL Trigger
    Lambda->>SES/SNS: Send Reminder
    SES/SNS-->>Lambda: Acknowledge
    Lambda->>DynamoDB: Retrieve Reminders
    DynamoDB-->>Lambda: Return Reminders
    Lambda->>S3 Bucket: Retrieve Front-End
    S3 Bucket-->>Lambda: Return Front-End
    Lambda->>CloudFront: Distribute Front-End
    CloudFront-->>User: Serve Front-End

Conclusion
The Reminder App Project system will be designed using AWS services to meet the requirements of allowing users to post reminders and receive notifications via email or text message. The system will be secured using IAM policies and will use DynamoDB's TTL feature and Lambda functions to automate the reminder and notification process. The front-end app will be hosted in an S3 bucket and distributed using CloudFront.
